Learning the basics of GitHub
My name is Benjamin Ingram and I have begun the journey of pivoting careers from a Regulatory Compliance Officer in the Fintech space to becoming a data analyst. I am interested in learning more about using Excel, SQL, and Python to build a foundation in data analytics tools in order to obtain employment in data analytics.
